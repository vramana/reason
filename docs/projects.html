Reason Projects
==============
Reason works with the build system that you use right now, but also paves the way
for rapidly developing and sharing large projects.

> Note: This Document Is Heavily Under Revision. Consider it a placeholder.
>

Reason currently integrates well into existing toolchains such as `ocamlbuild`,
but `Reason` also provides a specification called `Reason Project` which
specifies a workflow for how packages should connect together, and how they can be
developed/built locally inside of directory based sandboxes. We will link to a
reference implementation of this spec intended to demonstrate the workflow, but
are looking forward to scalable implementations that integrate with various
build tooling.

CommonML
-----------

CommonML is a completely standalone project builder built on top of `npm` and
`package.json` that acts as a reference implemention for the `Reason Project`
specification. It's really easy to get started with, and makes it very easy to
create/share several interconnected/namespaced packages.

`CommonML` is just a temporary example that should be replaced with something
more scalable and that integrates well with `OPAM`. For now, it's a fun way to
get started.



Once you've
[installed](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/README.md#install-stable)
`Reason`, you can clone the example CommonML playground.

###Example Project

#### Clone the Sample Project

Clone the example `Reason` project and use `npm` to install its dependencies.
Several compilation modes are supported such as bytecode, native binary, and
even debuggable `JavaScript`.

```sh
git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/jordwalke/ReasonExampleProject.git
cd ReasonExampleProject
npm install
```

###### Build Interpreted Mode

The default compilation mode compiles very quickly, and is ideal for rapid
development.

```sh
node ./node_modules/CommonML/build.js     # Build
_build_byte/ReasonExampleProject/reasonExampleProject.out  # Run
```


###### Build for Native

Passing `--compiler=native` will generate fast bare metal binaries.


```sh
node ./node_modules/CommonML/build.js --compiler=native
_build_native/ReasonExampleProject/reasonExampleProject.out
```

###### Compile to `JavaScript`

Passing `--forDebug=true --jSCompile=true` will compile debuggable `JavaScript`
builds of your native application, with source maps support.

```sh
node ./node_modules/CommonML/build.js --forDebug=true --jsCompile=true
node _build_byte/ReasonExampleProject/reasonExampleProject.out
```

###Modules and Package Visibility

The `Reason Project` spec (which `CommonML` adheres to) creates opinionated
conventions for defining namespaces for the code you write in `.re` files.

**Who can access my modules?**:
Suppose two packages exist as shown in the diagram. `MyModule.re` can access
the module `Utils`, and `Utils.re` can access the module `MyModule`. If
`YourProject` depends on `MyProject`, then `YourModule.re` can access
`MyProject.MyModule` and `MyProject.Utils`. The build system does not support
circular dependencies.

    └── MyProject/
        ├── package.json
        └── src/
            ├── MyModule.re
            └── MyUtils/
                └── Utils.re

    └── YourProject/
        ├── package.json   #depends on MyProject
        └── src/
            └── YourModule.re

** Adding new privately visible modules **

To add a new privately visible module, just add a new `YourModule.re` file
anywhere in your project. Other internal modules will instantly be able to see
it as `YourModule`. Adding a corresponding `YourModule.rei` in the same
directory will ensure that compilation times remain fast, and allow you to
constrain the type of `YourModule`.

** Adding new publicly visible modules **

The process for adding new publicly visible modules is the same as private
modules, but they must be added to the `CommonML.exports` field of the
`package.json`

###Incremental Compilation

Module signatures can greatly reduce compilation time by providing separate
compilation boundaries. They can play the role of "header files" in some sense.
If a module `X`'s, implementation changes we must recompile `X`.  If `X` had
been explicitly constrained to have a signature `XSig` which has *not* changed,
then other modules `Y`, `Z`, that depend on `X`, don't need to be recompiled
against the new build for `X`. We merely need to *relink* the previous build
artifacts for `Y` and `Z` against the new `X` artifact (which is much quicker).
However, if `X` did *not* constrain its signature to `XSig`, `Y` and `Z` *must*
be recompiled against the new artifact for `X`, and *then* relinked with `X`'s
new artifact.

> Note: Build system support for this optimization is not yet implemented.
