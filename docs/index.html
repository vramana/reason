`Reason` is a new interface to OCaml - a highly expressive dialect of the ML language
featuring type inference and static type checking.

`Reason` provides a new syntax and toolchain for editing, building, and sharing code, and
will evolve in the open as a community collaboration. `Reason` already has contributors
across several organizations/companies.

in the [README](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/README.md).


REPL
---------------

`Reason` comes with a REPL called `rtop` which lets you interactively evaluate
`Reason` syntax, and see the results printed in `Reason` syntax. It features
intelligent, type-driven autocompletion.

<img src="images/RtopOptCrop.gif" style="width:100%; max-width:466px; max-height:433px;">


```sh
# The rtop command begins a REPL session
rtop
```

```sh
let myVar = "Hello Reason!";
# myVar: bytes = "Hello Reason!"

let result = 100 + 200;
# result : int = 300;
```

> `rtop`'s intelligent autocompletion and compiler interaction is powered by
[`utop`](https://github.com/diml/utop). `utop` supports extension of custom
parsers and printers.

Syntax Basics
=======

Much of Reason's core syntax should be familiar to anyone who has ever used
modern `JavaScript` / [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) or `Rust`. The examples in this document give an
overview of the most important language constructs and their respective syntax.

Primitives
----------

> Primitive                                  | Example
> --------------------------------------|--------------------------------
> Strings                               |  <pre>"Hello"</pre>

> Reference Equality Comparison         |  <pre>thisThing === thatThing</pre>

> Record Field Update (if mutable field)|  <pre>myRecord.contents = 200</pre>


Let Bindings
------------
`let` bindings give names to values. Those bindings can be seen and referenced
by code that comes after those bindings, so long as the bindings are still "in scope".
To make `let` bindings, use the `let` keyword with an `=` symbol, and put a `;` after
the binding. Try creating some bindings in the [`rtop REPL`](#reason-repl)

```reason
let identifier = expression;
let identifier = expression;
...
```

#### Let Bindings in Source Files

Reason source files begin with an uppercase letter and use the `.re` file
suffix. Among other things, each `.re` file includes a series of `let` bindings.
In this example, a file `Hello.re` has two `let` bindings.

```reason
/*
 * Contents of Hello.re
 */
let message = "Do you use Reason?";
let response = "Why yes, I do indeed.";
```

#### Limiting Scope

`let` bindings tie a name to a value and that name may be referenced at a later
point in the file. To further limit scope of bindings, `Reason` provides `{}`
block *expressions* which let you sequence `let`s together and then *evaluates*
to the last item in the sequence. In this example, the binding `three`
evaluates to the `integer` `3`.  The `{}` block ensures that `one` and `two`
are not accessible after `three` is computed.

```reason
let three = {
  let one = 1;
  let two = 2;
  one + two
};
/* one and two not accessible here! */
```
> Note that the last item may optionally include a terminating semicolon.

#### Constant bindings

`let` bindings are immutable. Once a binding refers to a value, it cannot
refer to anything else. However, you may create a new binding of the same
name which will *shadow* the previous binding.

```reason
/* Prints "hello bye" */
let msg = "hello ";
print_string msg;
let msg = "bye";
print_string msg;
```


#### Imperative Code

You may interleave imperative commands such as logging along with your let
bindings. This works both for `let` bindings in files, and also in block
scopes. Interleaved imperative commands don't change what block expressions
evaluate to.

```reason
let three = {
  let one = 1;
  print_string "fire the missiles";
  let two = 2;
  one + two
};
```

Types Basics
--------------------------

#### Type Annotations

Even though types are inferred (you don't _have_ to write them out), you may
still choose to write "type assertions" on any expression. Anywhere you would
normally write an expression, just append `: yourType`, and then wrap the
result in parenthesis.


```reason
(expression : typeConstraint)
```


These assertions are then verified by the compiler.
```reason
let bindingOne = 5;
let bindingOne = (5 : int);
let bindingOne = (5 : int) + (4 : int);
let bindingOne = ((5 : int) + (4 : int) : int);
```
The other place that type assertions are accepted is immediately following the
`let` keyword. This is equivalent to asserting the type of the expression on
the right hand side of the `=`.
```reason
let identifier : typeConstraint = expression;
let identifier = (expression : typeConstraint);
```

<br />

```reason
/* Equivalent type assertions. */
let frameworkName = ("React": string);
let frameworkName : string = "React";
```

#### Type Aliases

You may refer to a type by a different name, by creating a type alias with the
`type` keyword. The new type alias may be used in annotations as well. You can
see there is somewhat of a "scope" for `type` aliases, similar to `let`
bindings.

```reason
type myType = int;
let x: myType = 10;  /* Now we can "see" myType */
```

Tuples
--------------------------

A tuple is a list of values of *known* size, such as "pair". They are written
as comma delimited lists, always wrapped in parenthesis.


```reason
let myThreeFloats = (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
let myIntAndString = (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

Tuples have types and those types can be used in type annotations as well.
Tuple types resemble tuples themselves - comma delimited lists of types,
wrapped in parenthesis.

```reason
let myThreeFloats: (float, float, float)  = (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
let myIntAndString: (int, string) = (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

Tuples represent two or more values together, but sometimes you want to
represent *zero* values. In `Reason`, you can express this idea by writing
`()`. We call this thing "unit", and it has type `unit`.

```reason
let nothing = ();
```

You may create type aliases for tuple types just like you can with any other
type.
```reason
type threeFloats = (float, float, float);
type intAndString = (int, string);

let myThreeFloats: threeFloats = (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
let myIntAndString: intAndString = (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

Records
-------

Records are a set of named values. They resemble "objects" (from OO) but they
are simpler, less flexible, and offer extremely fast field access. To create a
record, some type definition describing its fields must be in scope.  In
`Reason`,  type definitions for records resemble the shape of the records
values they describe.


```reason
type person = {age: int, name: string};
let me = {age: 30, name: "Jordan"};
print_string me.name;
```

New records may be easily created from old records with the `...` spread
operator, which changes a subset of the fields, but doesn't alter the original
record.

> Note: spread cannot add new fields.

```reason
let meNextYear =  {
  ...me,
  age: me.age + 1
};
```

##### Mutable record fields.

When defining the record type, you can mark some record fields as `mutable`.
This allows you to update those fields with the `=` operator. In general,
having language level distinction between `mutable` and immutable offers
opportunities for compile time performance optimizations.

```reason
type person = {
  name: string,
  mutable age: int
};
let me = {name: "Jordan", age: 30};
me.age = me.age + 1;
```

Destructuring
-------------
"Destructuring" can be used to extract one or more fields from a record or
tuple, while automatically binding them to local variables. Any place variables
are introduced into scope, you may use destructuring. To destructure, instead
of writing the variable name as usual, write out the deep shape of the object.


> The following binds variables:
> `ten = 10`, `twenty = 20`

```reason
let someInts = (10, 20);
let (ten, twenty) = someInts;
```

> The following binds variables:
> `n = "Guy"`, `a = 30`

```reason
type person = {name: string, age: int};
let somePerson = {name: "Guy", age: 30};
let {name: n, age: a} = somePerson;
```

Destructuring also allows type annotations *while* destructuring.
```reason
let (ten: int, twenty: int) = someInts;
let {name: (n:string), age: (a:int)} = somePerson;
```



Functions
---------

Functions are introduced with the `fun` keyword, followed by the name of the
arguments, an arrow `=>` then any expression as the return value. You may omit
the parenthesis around the argument when the argument is clearly "one unit"
(such as a simple variable name).

```reason
fun (argument) => expression
```
Functions are first class and you can use `let` bindings to give them names.


```reason
let increment = fun (x) => x + 1;
let double = fun x => x + x;
```
> We've chosen to omit the parenthesis around the second function's argument.

To call a function, supply its argument after the name of the function.

```reason
let six = increment(5);
let thirteen = increment(double(6));
```
Just like with function definitions, you can omit the parenthesis around the
argument when you call the function, if the argument clearly "one unit". In
this example, the `5` is clearly one unit so the `()` were omitted. The
parenthesis around `double 6`, could _not_ be omitted because `double 6` is not
"one unit".


```reason
let six = increment 5;
let thirteen = increment (double 6);
```

#### 

Functions can return any expression, but "block expressions" are often chosen
because they allow declaring temporary, block-scoped variables, and allow
performing side effects.

```reason
let doSomeMath = fun arg => {
  let tmp = 2 * arg;
  let next = 3 * arg;
  tmp * next
};

let performsSideEffects = fun arg => {
  print_string "Entering the function";
  let tmp = 2 * arg;
  let next = 3 * arg;
  print_string "Returning from the function";
  tmp * next
};
```

#### Arguments

You can pass multiple pieces of data at once to the function, by passing a
tuple. A function argument may be [destructured](#syntax-basics-destructuring)
"on the way into" the function which gives you convenient access to each item
in the tuple.
```reason
let addTupleFields = fun (first, second) => {
  first + second
};
let five = addTupleFields (4, 1);
```

The tuple is still first class, and the function still accepts a single argument, so
you could have also called the function like this:
```reason
let myTuple = (4, 1);
let five = addTupleFields myTuple;
```


You can pass, and destructure a tuple with zero elements as well.

```reason
let logToUser = fun () => {
  print_string "Logging to user";
  print_string "Okay, logging done";
};
/* Now call it */
logToUser ();
```


#### 
You can pass/destructure records too. (If record type
definitions are in scope).

```reason
let isOverThirty = fun {name: n, age: a} => {
  let ret = a > 30;
  ret
};
let overThirty = isOverThirty {name: "Jay", age: 31};
```

You may annotate the types of individual parts of the destructuring on the way
into the function.
```reason
let addTupleFields = fun (first:int, second:int) => {
  first + second
};
let isOverThirty = fun {name: (n:int), age: (a:int)} => {
  let ret = a > 30;
  ret
};
```


#### Function Types
Function types are written by listing the argument type, an arrow, and then
the return type.

```reason
argumentType => expressionType
```

Here, we create a type alias for the types of functions in the previous
examples and then we assert that they are compatible with those functions.

```reason
type intTupleToInt = (int, int) => int
type intToInt = int => int;
let a = (increment : intToInt);
let b = (addTupleFields : intTupleToInt);
```




#### Recursive Functions

By default, values can't see a binding that points to it, but including the
`rec` keyword in a `let` binding makes this possible. This allows functions
to see and call themselves, giving us the power of recursion.

```reason
let rec neverTerminate = fun () => neverTerminate ();
```

#### Mutually Recursive Functions

Mutually recursive functions start like a single recursive function using the
`rec` keyword, and then are chained together with `and`:

```reason
let rec callSecond = fun () => callFirst ()
and callFirst = fun () => callSecond ();
```

#### Functions Returning Functions

Functions can return other functions. Here's a function `createAdder` that
creates an adder function. We call `createAdder` first with `4`, and then call
the result of that with `1`.

```reason
let createAdder = fun addAmount => (
  fun x => addAmount + x
);
let five = createAdder(4)(1);
```

`createAdder` has the following type. This type tells us that it is a function
that when called with an `int`, will return *another* function. That returned
function itself expects an `int` and returns an `int`. The parenthesis may be
omitted.

```reason
int => (int => int)
```

This pattern is called "currying", and because it is so common, `Reason`
includes some syntactic sugar for it. Here is the previous example, but written
using the syntactic sugar. Many people use this pattern because it simulates
multiple arguments.


```reason
let createAdder = fun addAmount x => addAmount + x;
let five = createAdder 4 1;
```
> Note: Curried functions don't typically incur performance hit when all the
arguments are supplied at once because intermediate function allocations are
optimized away!

[Learn more about currying](#diving-deeper-curried-functions)


Variants
--------

Variant types allows data to have either one form *or* another. In Reason, each
form is given a capitalized name called a "constructor" (not in the OO sense).
To declare a variant type, enumerate every constructor by the `|` token.

```reason
type response =
  | Yes
  | No
  | PrettyMuch;
let areYouCrushingIt = Yes;
```

A `switch` expression is like a large `if/elseif/elseif..`, but much more
powerful. To use it, enumerate every variant constructor, each followed by an `=>`
and the expression that the entire `switch` should evaluate to for that case. In
this example, the `message` variable is assigned the string `"..."`.

```reason
let isSafeToLaunchRocket = PrettyMuch;
let message = switch isSafeToLaunchRocket {
  | No => "Check Integrity."
  | Yes => "All Systems Go."
  | PrettyMuch => "..."
};
```

The compiler will raise a type error if you've forgotten to cover a case of your
variant, or if two cases are redundant. You can also destructure while
enumerating the cases. See more below.

##### Constructor Arguments

Reason constructors are not your OO constructors. They're more like functions
for variants. They may contain one or more pieces of data by declaring those
contained types in a space-separated list after the constructor.

```reason
type account =
  | None
  | Facebook string int
  | Instagram string;
```

> Instantiating a constructor that carries data is exactly the same as
calling a function. Supply the data as space separated "arguments".

```reason
let myAccount = Facebook "Kay" 1234;  /* Accepts two arguments */
let yourAccount = None;               /* Accepts no arguments */
```

##### Destructuring Arguments of a Constructor

Once created, constructor data can be extracted via destructuring, much like
with tuples. In this example, a local variable `x` is bound to `42`.
`getTheInt` extracts a `Leaf`'s contained integer "on the way into" the function.

```reason
type intLeaf = | Leaf int;
let myIntLeaf = Leaf 42;

let Leaf x = myIntLeaf;
let getTheInt = fun (Leaf q) => q;
let fourtyTwo = getTheInt myIntLeaf;
let twentyNine = getTheInt (Leaf 29);
```

** When Simple Destructuring Isn't Enough: **
Simple destructuring isn't sufficient for variants types with many
constructors. The following example would clearly have to fail at runtime!
Fortunately, the compiler forbids this.

```reason
type possibleNum =
  | NotDefined
  | Defined integer;

let myNumber = NotDefined;
let Defined x = myNumber;   /* Type error! */
```
** The Solution: ** To recover data in variants with many constructors,
`switch` allows us to enumerate each constructor *while* destructuring the
constructor's data on the left side of the `=>`.  Unlike our previous naive
attempt, this works because we enumerate every possible constructor name inside
of the `switch`.

> Note: We've safely unpacked the `i` from `Defined i`, because we've *also*
> specified what to do when `myNumber` was `NotDefined`.

```reason
let x = switch myNumber {
  | Defined i => i
  | NotDefined => 0
};
```
##### Multiple Arguments vs. Tuples (*Details*)

Notice that a variant constructor that contains many fields is different than a
variant constructor that carries a single field that happens to be a tuple.
Among other differences, tuples are not "inlined" into the variant object's
runtime representation, whereas, multiple constructor arguments incur no
additional abstraction cost (they are "inlined" into the variant data).

```reason
type toTupleOrNotToTuple =
   | HasTuple (int, int, int)
   | NoTuple int int int;

let aTuple = HasTuple (1, 2, 3);
let notTuple = NoTuple 1 2 3;

let sumsZero = switch x {
  | HasTuple (a, b, c) => a + b + c == 0
  | NoTuple a b c => a + b + c == 0
};

```

Loops and Tests
---------------

#### If Expressions

The syntax for `if` expressions should look very familiar. Just like within
function "bodies", the `{}` braces may include a sequence of temporary `let`
bindings or imperative commands, all separated by `;`. An `if` statement may
include an optional `else` branch.

```reason
if (testCondition) {
  ifTrue
};

if (testCondition) {
  ifTrue
} else {
  ifFalse
};
```

In this example, the word `"hi"` is printed if `sayHi` is `true`, and prints
`"bye"` otherwise.
```reason
if (sayHi) {
  print_string "hi";
} else {
  print_string "bye";
};
```

> Note: The parenthesis around the test condition may be omitted if the test
condition is "simple" enough (meaning it is a single, standalone word).

If expressions aren't just for imperative code - they can also be used to
compute a result. Just place an expression on the final line of the `{}`
sequence for each branch. If your `if` expression has no `else` branch, it
is clearly only useful for imperative programming and therefore the entire `if`
will evaluate to the unit value `()`.


```reason
let valueToLog =
  if (booleanTest) {
    let tmp = "name";
    String.capitalize tmp;
  } else {
    "default";
  };
```

`if`/`else` expressions may be chained together in a familiar manner.

```reason
if (sayHi) {
  print_string "hi";
} else if (sayBye) {
  print_string "bye";
} else {
  print_string "nothing to say";
};
```
#### Ternaries

For smaller boolean if else statements, `Reason` includes a ternary expression
which might look more aesthetically pleasing in some cases.

```reason
testCondition ? ifTrue : ifFalse
```

```reason
let valueToLog = shouldUseDefault ? 200 : yourNumber;
```


#### For Loops

For loops are fully imperative constructs that iterate through a range of
numbers, from a beginning value up to (and including) the ending value. The
general form of a `for` loop includes an identifier that is incremented each
iteration, and a range `startVal` to `endVal`.

```reason
for identifier in (startVal) to (endVal) {
  statements
}
```

The parenthesis around the `startVal` and `endVal` may be omitted if they are
clearly unnecessary as in the following example.

```reason
let xStart = 1;
let xEnd = 3;
/* prints: 1 2 3 */
for x in xStart to xEnd {
  print_int x;
  print_string " ";
}
```

You can make the `for` loop count in the opposite direction by using the `downto`
keyword.

```reason
for identifier in (startVal) downto (endVal) {
  statements
}
```

```reason
let xStart = 3;
let xEnd = 1;
/* prints: 3 2 1 */
for x in xStart downto xEnd {
  print_int x;
  print_string " ";
}
```

#### While Loops

Type Parameters
----------
Some types are very specific, such as `int`, or `string`, but other types
are much more general. For example, knowing that a value has type `list`,
leaves so many unanswered questions - namely, what's *in* the list?! `list`
is clearly a more general type.

Recall how functions act as factories for other _values_. Supplying a function
with a parameter produces a new value. In the same way, some types, such
as `list`, act as factories for other _types_ - if you supply them a **"type
parameter"**, they generate another type.  This example shows supplying the
`list` type factory with `string`. It results in a type describing
lists of strings.

```reason
type listOfStrings = list string;
let lst : listOfStrings = ["hi", "bye"];
```
> Notice the syntactic similarity between supplying function parameters and
type parameters.


You can define your own custom "type factories" by using the following syntax.
Notice the `'` before the `typeParam`. `typeStructure` can be any form of type
that is allowed to reference `typeParam`.

```reason
type typeFactoryName 'typeParam = typeStructure;
```

For example, you could define a family of tuple types like this:

```reason
type tupleTypeFactory 'a = ('a, 'a);
```

Then you could create more specific types by "calling" the `tupleTypeFactory` type
generating "function" as follows:

```reason
type tupleOfInts = tupleTypeFactory int;
type tupleOfStrings = tupleTypeFactory string;
```

To make type factories that accept multiple type parameters, list all of the
parameters next to each other. Then to use the type factory, supply all
of the type parameters as if you were calling a curried function.


```reason
type tupleOf 'left 'right = ('left, 'right);
type tupleOfIntString = tupleOf int string;
```

The type factories can define record and variant shapes that make full use of
the type parameters.

```reason
type containerOf 'a = {containedThing: 'a};
let c : containerOf int = {containedThing: 10};

type result 'a 'b =
  | Ok 'a
  | Error 'b
let r : result string int = Ok "here is the result";
```

Exceptions
----------
Exceptions are just a special kind of [variant](#syntax-basics-variants) that
can be "thrown" in exceptional cases. When you have powerful variants, you
often don't _need_ exceptions because you can just use variants types such as
the defined `type result` above. But for exceptional cases, it's great to
have the ability to throw exceptions up the call stack and catch them at
convenient recovery points. Thankfully, these two separate, but useful
constructs are unified into one handler abstraction so you can `switch` on the
result of a function call, but add cases for handling exceptions that occured.

More details coming soon.

Diving Deeper
==============

Curried Functions
-----------------

#### Currying vs. Tuples.

Instead of having a function accept a tuple as an argument, you might choose to
make that function curried instead. Currying accomplishes the same goal, but
allows you to supply the set of input data one at a time, potentially "pausing"
when you've only supplied a portion of the argument data. Compare this to
passing a tuple where you must supply all of the data at once.


#### Named Curried Functions

One downside to curried functions is that they are "biased" to arguments that
appear first. Meaning, when you curry functions, you can "partially apply" some
of the arguments, saving the rest for later, but you can only partially apply
the arguments that come *first*. Labelled curried functions address this
concern by letting you assign *labels* to arguments, and then partially apply
arguments by their label, regardless of their *position*. Labels are created by
simply prepending `labelName::` to the function argument.

```reason

let add =
  fun first::f second::s => f + s;

let result = add first::10 second::20;

let addFour = add second::4;

let five = addFour first::1;

```

Labelled curried arguments also allow setting default values using the equals
sign. The way defaults work is a little tricky, but here's the general rule:
When calling functions, default arguments are "filled in" as soon as you supply
a *non-named* argument. More specifically - all of the default arguments to the
*left* of that non-named argument are filled in, as soon as the non-named argument
is supplied at invocation time.

```reason

/* Notice how `by` is to the left of `num` */
let increment = fun by::by=0 num => num + by;

let two = increment by::1 1;

let four = increment 4;

```


Expressive Pattern Matching
---------------------------
There are several destructuring conveniences that pair well with compiler
verified `switch` expressions.
For example, you can express arbitrarily nested destructuring "patterns", which
the compiler will ensure have no uncovered cases. In this example, `name` is
bound to `"Jo"` and `model` is bound to `"Tacoma"`.

```reason
type car = {model: string, make: string};
let toyota = {make: "Toyota", model: "Tacoma"};

type carOwner =
  | CarOwner string car; /* May as well be a tuple */

let CarOwner name {model: model, make: make} = CarOwner "Jo" toyota;
```

##### 
This deep pattern matching is especially expressive when used in `switch`
expressions. In this example, the function `hasExactlyTwoCars` has specified
what to return in four cases in very little code. Even more helpful, is the
fact that the compiler verifies that no two edge cases are redundant, and that
every possible case has been covered. It turns out, that pattern matching
becomes an extremely powerful tool to enforce constraints in your program. The
more you model your program in terms of variants, the more the compiler assists
you stop bugs before they even run - the end result being more rapid
development. This `ML` pattern matching is famous for coining the phrase: "If
it compiles, it works!".

```reason
type carList =
  | List car carList
  | NoMore;

let chevy = {make: "Chevy", model: "Suburban"};
let toyota = {make: "Toyota", model: "Tacoma"};
let myCarList = List chevy (List toyota NoMore);

let hasExactlyTwoCars = fun lst =>
  switch lst {
    | NoMore => false                         /* 0 */
    | List p NoMore => false                  /* 1 */
    | List p (List p2 NoMore) => true         /* 2 */
    | List p (List p2 (List p3 rest)) => false  /* 3+ */
  };

let justTwo = hasExactlyTwoCars myCarList;  /* true! */

```

Syntactic Sugar (Abbreviations)
----------------------------------


##### Function Definitions
You have already seen one form of function syntactic sugar. Though it appears that
functions accept multiple arguments, every function actually only accepts a
single argument. "Multiple arguments" separated by spaces are actually defining
a series of curried functions. The two function definitions on the right are equivalent.

```reason
let add = fun a b => a + b;
/* Is the same as */
let add = fun a => fun b => a + b;
```

Function application for a curried
function can look very clean in many cases,
because parentheses around the function argument may be omitted if the argument
is clearly a single word or a grouping.

```reason
let five = add(4)(1);
/* Is the same as */
let five = add 4 1;
```

You only need to include parentheses around arguments when it otherwise
wouldn't obviously be a single item.
```reason
let five = add (firstEvaluateThis 0 0) 1;
```
> Note: You pay no additional performance cost for curried functions
when they are invoked with all the arguments. You may even ignore the fact that
currying is occurring at all, if you like.

##### Function Let Binding
There is one more function binding syntax that has not yet been shown: When a function
is defined with a `let` binding, the syntax `= fun` may be omitted.
All the function definitions on the right are equivalent.

```reason
/* All of the following are equivalent. */
let add a b => a + b;
let add = fun a b => a + b;
let add = fun a => fun b => a + b;
```

##### Module Functions Definitions

[Module Functions](./modules.html#modules-module-functions) follow the same syntactic convention as regular
functions. Space-separated arguments are actually currified *module functions*
and the syntax `= fun` may be omitted, resulting in three forms of module function
definitions which are all equivalent.

```reason
/* All of the following are equivalent. */
let module ModuleFunc (A:ASig) (B:BSig) => {};
let module ModuleFunc = fun (A:ASig) (B:BSig) => {};
let module ModuleFunc = fun (A:ASig) => fun (B:BSig) => {};
```

##### Record *Value* "Punning"

If variables in scope have the same name as record fields, then record
expressions can be written in a shorter form, where `name:name` can be
abbreviated as `name`. This is called "punning" (just like JavaScript ES6).

```reason
type myRecord = {first: int, second: int};
let first = "f";
let second = "s";

/* The following are equivalent. */
let theRecord = {first:first, second:second};
let theRecord = {first, second};

/* Or only take the shortcut for a subset of the fields. */
let theRecord = {first, second: 0};

```

##### Record *Pattern* "Punning"

The same record "punning" syntax may be used with destructuring, in all of the
places where destructuring is allowed (`let` bindings, function arguments,
`switch` matching).

```reason
let {first:first, second:second} = theRecord;
let {first, second} = theRecord;   /* Abbreviation */

let sumsToZero = fun {first, second} => first + second == 0;
```

How Reason Works
=========================

The OCaml compiler is organized into several stages, which are exposed as
libraries. `Reason` replaces part of the compiler toolchain with a completely
new syntax parser that is more approachable, while still fully compatible with
the rest of the compiler.  `Reason` also implements a new source printer which
integrates into your IDE and the new custom [`REPL`](#reason-repl).

###### Why OCaml?

OCaml is a great tool for writing highly expressive, functional
*or* imperative code, with type inference and fast runtime performance.
Because of these properties, OCaml has helped
Facebook quickly build scalable infrastructure such as
[Hack](http://hacklang.org/), [Flow](http://flowtype.org/), and
[Infer](http://fbinfer.com/). It is also used for other performance sensitive
applications in the financial industry (Jane Street, Bloomberg). At the same
time, OCaml has a very mature (*and still growing*) ecosystem for targeting
browser and `JavaScript` environments with a focus on language interoperability
and integration with existing `JavaScript` code.


`Reason`'s non-invasive approach to the `OCaml` compiler allows `Reason` code
to take advantage of all of the existing `OCaml` compiler
optimizations/backends such as bare metal `ARM`, `x86`, and even `JavaScript`
compilation.


###### In the Wild

[Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer) is a Facebook open
source project for statically analyzing source code in order to find errors.
You can see `Infer`'s use of `Reason`
[here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer/src/IR).
The `Infer` team along with other members of industry are major contributors to
`Reason`.



###### Acknowledgments

`Reason` is also a curation of best-in-class tools. It already incorporates
several technologies that make the `Reason` developer
experience possible.

- `OCaml` itself.
- `utop` - highly customizable repl.
- `Merlin` - assistant for editing OCaml code that has extensively refactored
in order to support `Reason`.


What's Next + FAQ
=========================

#### What's Next:
- Sandboxes for locally developing large projects of interconnected smaller packages.
- Project scaffolding / build system (or merely build rules for existing systems).
- Library curation (precompiled, fast installed libraries)
- Improvements to syntax, iterating based on feedback.
- Everything installable with a single command.


#### FAQ

- **Q**: Is `ppx` supported?
- **A**: Support for `ppx` (lightweight macros for `ocaml`) is a goal which
we've made good progress towards. You should be able to use all of your
existing `ppx` plugins with `Reason`.


- **Q**: Has something like this been tried before (a different syntax for `ocaml`)?
- **A**: We're not aware of anything that takes `Reason`'s specific approach to
syntax, which pushes the major syntax customization closer into the IDE space
(and with a much greater focus on source formatting)
while relying exclusively on the new `ppx` extensions for macro-like
extensibility. `ppx` did not exist until recently and its existence
dramatically influences the approach/focus.


- **Q**: I don't like one of the syntax features.
- **A**: We are still iterating based on feedback we've received, and there's a good
chance other people feel similarly. For now, we've focused mostly on putting
all the right tools in place specifically so that we can easily make changes in
response to feedback or proposals, without having to be locked into design
decisions. Please discuss specific requests on the [Reason
project](https://github.com/facebook/reason) page.

- **Q**: I don't like semicolons, because they make code less "functional".
- **A**: Please see the last question/answer. For the specific case of semicolons,
it is false that semicolons make code any more or less functional, and at least
in `Reason`, semicolons are simply used as a delimiter that assist in formatting
and interleaving of comments. The `;` delimiter could just has easily have been
the word `in`, or the monkey emoji `🐒`. It should also be possible to remove
the need for these delimiters in all but a few cases.


####Contribute

*After* setting up `OPAM` and your `switch` in the general [installation
instructions](./index.html#reason-install), do the following to live on the
bleeding edge and make changes to `Reason`.

**1. Ensure a Clean Slate:**
These commands remove any versions of packages you might
have installed in the stable [installation
instructions](./index.html#reason-install).
```sh
opam pin remove merlin
opam pin remove merlin_extend
opam pin remove reason
```

**2. `pin` the `master` versions of everything:**
See [INSTALL STABLE](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/README.md#install-stable)
for up to date instructions.

**3. Clone `Reason` and `pin` that local clone:** Pinning your locally built
`Reason` clone makes your local build of `Reason` visible globally.

```sh
git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/facebook/Reason.git
cd Reason
make
opam pin add -y reason .
```

**4. Make Changes and `upgrade`:**
When you make changes to `Reason`, and build successfully, those changes don't
take effect in the globally installed version of `Reason` until you `upgrade`
`Reason`.

```sh
# Test changes
cd Reason
make
opam upgrade reason
```
